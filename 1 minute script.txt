Hey! I'm Lucian, the geek who is turning a childhood obsession with tech into Free Humans World, a Web 3 world. Let’s take a rapid-fire journey through my story.

I come from a poor family of art school teachers and I have 3 younger siblings.
I started my tech journey with a screwdriver at 7, I was dismantling toys to learn their secrets.
Fast forward: built my first game console at 14, my own website at 15, and was the local tech wizard by 17.

I’ve done it all.
Fixed PCs, built game worlds, even helped folks discover the internet.
Every step fueled my passion for creating spaces where technology brings us closer.

15 years of web R&D later, I'm 36 now, and more excited than ever.

Now, imagine a digital world where your creativity earns you Gratitude Tokens that have real utility. That’s Free Humans World. It’s secure, it’s democratic, and it’s where your ideas make a difference.

Join me in making this vision a reality.
Let's shape Free Humans World together, where every share, every like, every creation enriches our world with information and value owned by the people, not by a single company.
